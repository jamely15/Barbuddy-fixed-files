# README for Fixed Files

This document describes the changes made to the following files to fix database persistence issues in the Bar Buddy project:

- `backend/trpc/routes/user/create-profile/route.ts`
- `stores/userProfileStore.ts`
- `stores/venueInteractionStore.ts`

---

## 1. backend/trpc/routes/user/create-profile/route.ts

### Purpose:
Handles the creation and upsert of user profiles during user sign-up or profile creation.

### Changes Made:
- Corrected the Supabase table name from `"profiles"` to `"user_profiles"` to match the actual database schema.
- Updated column names in the upsert operation to align with the database schema (e.g., `profile_pic` instead of `profile_picture`).
- Added creation and update timestamps (`created_at`, `updated_at`) during profile creation.
- Improved error handling and logging for better debugging.

## 2. stores/userProfileStore.ts

### Purpose:
Manages user profile state, loading, updating, and related operations in the frontend using Zustand.

### Changes Made:
- Updated all Supabase queries to use the `"user_profiles"` table instead of `"profiles"`.
- Adjusted friend requests and friends queries to use the `"user_profiles"` alias for proper joins.
- Ensured profile creation, loading, updating, and searching use the correct table and column names.
- Added creation and update timestamps during profile creation.
- Improved error handling and logging.
- Maintained local persistence with AsyncStorage for offline support.

## 3. stores/venueInteractionStore.ts

### Purpose:
Manages venue interaction state (check-ins, likes) in the frontend using Zustand.

### Changes Made:
- Implemented `syncToSupabase` method to persist venue interactions to the Supabase `"venue_interactions"` table.
- Implemented `loadPopularTimesFromSupabase` method to load venue interactions from Supabase on app start.
- Added error handling and logging for syncing operations.
- Ensured local state updates and UI reactivity with `forceUpdate`.
- Maintained local persistence with AsyncStorage for offline support.
